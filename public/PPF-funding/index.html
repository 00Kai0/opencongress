<p>
The Participatory Politics Foundation is a 501©3 non-profit organization with a mission to increase civic engagement. We believe that the Web has created an unprecedented opportunity for individuals to educate themselves in public affairs and take political actions. The results will include a more deliberative democracy and stronger, healthier communities. 
</p>

<p>
Since 2007, our free & open-source software and Web sites have made government more transparent and accountable:

<h2 class="center">Fundraising Mission Statement - We have a good start, with ambitious plans...</h2>

<p>
PPF’s goal is to expand and create mass-market tools that integrate meaningful political participation into daily activities. Together, we can promote a more “participatory politics” -- not only open data & government transparency websites, but also ambitious, never-before-seen, user-focused organizing tools for millions of people worldwide. 
</p>


<p>
PPF’s vision is to build popular technology for the entire civic experience. Open standards (e.g., Open311) can make political actions & personal opinions portable as part of your online identity. This is the potential of free software on the open Web: robust democracy, increased faith in government, better public policy outcomes, and healthier communities.
Our short- and medium-term needs include the following, as we work towards our non-profit sustainability plan ::

<li>  Maintain our massive database of open government data & enhance our open API and free widget offerings, all free in the public commons.</li>

<li> Enhance our just-launched version 3 features: Contact-Congress, including campaign contribution data in our custom Message Builder; and MyOC Groups, for grassroots organizing around bills and issues.</li>

<li> Looking ahead, turn OC into a powerful two-way platform for constituent communication with their members of Congress and a forum for deliberative democracy & participatory budgeting. </li>

<li> Bring OG down to the city & local levels by incorporating open municipal government data, first as a pilot project and then more widely </li>

<li>  Expand OG internationally in partnership with #opengov advocates in other countries, as well as transparency for international institutions.  </li>

<h2 class="center">New PPF Project Sketches (medium-term) - in more detail, feedback welcome
</h2>
</div>


<div class="grid_12">  


<ol>

<li>   (PPF + PCF) collaboration: revamped AdTracker for 2012, an open platform for tracking campaign videos built on Miro Community and incorporating information, context, and public opinion from OpenCongress (federal races) & OpenGovernment (state & city elections). Proposed video hub will meet public demand for authoritative facts & campaign donation data.</li>
<li>
State, city, and local dashboards of constituent opinion - currently, hyper-local portals like EveryBlock don’t offer a digestible overview of what political issues constituents care about and specific bills or community issues on which they’re communicating with officials. From users who opt-in to register with their address, OpenCongress can display civic actions at the level of states, cities (5-digit zip codes), down to city blocks (zip plus-four). It’s a new view towards deliberative democracy.</li>
<li>
Money-in-politics message-builder for Rootstrikers & other reformers - new features will make it easier than ever to enforce public accountability “with teeth”. Users can alert elected officials that they’re tracking campaign contributions, down to specific donations from businesses & lobbyists, then organizing other constituents around the bills & issues they support. </li>
<li>
Additional project areas include campaigns around the following: range voting, net neutrality, non-partisan re-districting, comprehensive electoral reform, universal voter registration, revoking corporate personhood, and encouraging independent political parties for more parliamentary & substantively representative democracy. </li>

</ol>

<p class="grid_6 alpha">Help us grow and build amazing new tools for deliberative democracy. Our team has a strong reputation record of building truly popular products, but our limiting factor is a lack of major funding support for open-source non-profit software & Web apps. With additional tax-exempt donations to our non-profit organization for open-source Web development time, we can create popular technology that delivers the wide-ranging benefits of a strong democracy.</p>

“I have been hankering for this resource for some time now! I received this e-mail from our executive director at Families and Friends of Louisiana’s Incarcerated Children.  I often used OpenCongress working with organizations in DC and thought, how can we get local coverage & if it was even possible. This is truly great work and we will be excited to use it this session when we are hoping to see some reforms pass.”

OpenGovernment is the first open-source & non-profit website to bring together official information, campaign contribution data, social wisdom through news & blog coverage, and public comments. </p>

<p>
The site’s main categories of information are bills, votes (with full roll call visualizations), legislators (both upper & lower chambers), committees, issue areas, businesses and individual donors from FollowTheMoney & MAPLight.org.
