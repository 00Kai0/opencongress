    %strong We do not know your exact Congressional District.
    This is most likely because your zipcode overlaps multiple Congressional District boundaries.
  %p.behave
    Due to recent changes to OpenCongress, we now require all users to link their account to their Congressional District.
  %p.behave
    Please enter your street address in field below and we'll determine your district.  We will NOT store this info -- it will only be used now.
