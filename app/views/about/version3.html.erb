Unlike other websites, we provide this as a public service and our data (except personal info) is entirely open for the public benefit. From this foundation of transparent constituent communication, new levels of government accountability can be built.<br><br>
      
      If you like these new user-friendly tools to organize your communities around bills & issues in Congress, support our work with a tax-exempt donation. We're a tiny team building big (not-for-profit) things, and we need your help.<br><br>
          
      Charitable foundations, political bloggers, issue-based groups -- we seek additional funding support of our technology for building public knowledge, mitigating systemic corruption, and facilitating deliberative democracy. Get in touch!</p>
